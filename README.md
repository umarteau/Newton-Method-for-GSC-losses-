# Newton-method-for-GSC-losses-

## Intro

This repository provides the code used to run the experiments of the paper "Globally Convergent Newton Methods for Ill-conditioned Generalized Self-concordant functions" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01771). In particular, the folder SECOND ORDER METHOD contains a preliminary python implementation of the algorithm, that uses CPU and one GPU.
